# OS-memory-simulation

## Description

This projects aims to simulate the _malloc()_ and _free()_ system functions by creating a virtual memory and managing it following common system policies (paging, allocation operations: _first/best/worst fit_, process simulation).

The projects uses _ncurses_ library for an intuitive graphical interface.

The goal is purely academic, the project can be used to demonstrate memory usage for new computer science students.
